# Hack The Midlands 2018
## Achimator

The goal of this 24 hour hackathon for my team was to produce an application on Google Cloud Platform which:
1. scrapes Panopto for video recordings of our favourite lecturer Achim Jung, pulling only the audio sources;
2. transcribes the wealth of audio data into text;
3. feeds the audio back into a Markov chain library, to try and come up with funny new 'lectures'.

It kinda worked, but wasn't really ready for prime time by the end of the hackathon. ;)
A great learning experience nonetheless.
